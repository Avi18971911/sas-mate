Handles Serial connection. Searches ports, connects to arduino and writes data on serial line.

void searchForPorts()

- Searches for ports
- Lists them in an ArrayList
- Port name ArrayList can be accessed through getPorts()

ArrayList<String> getPorts()

- If ports are found, resulting ArrayList is printed.
- If not found, searchForPorts() is called again and attempts to list ports
- If there still are no ports around, null is returned. 

void connect(String portSelected)

- connects to the serial port "portSelected"
- note: if there are multiple ports found in getPorts(), you're doing something wrong (two arduinos?)
- #TODO

boolean isConnected()

- returns true if connected, false if else.
